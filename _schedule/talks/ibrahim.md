From existing technology product to new ideas, the African environment should
be considered at the conception level.

When talking about technology, Africa
is very different from most of the rest of the world, and thus, we should
implement different ways of doing things like distributing music, banking,
traveling or crafting.

A few concrete examples/ideas will be given on how things could be implemented the "African way". I
strongly believe that python is one of the best tools for that due to its simplicity,
accessibility, versatility and big community.
