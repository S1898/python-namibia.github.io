title: "What's the point of Object Orientation?"
speaker: Iwan Vosloo
location: Room 02
day: Wednesday
duration: 45 minutes
---

Object Orientation (OO) is often introduced in terms of how it is implemented
by a specific language. However, understanding the theory underlying OO is not
quite the same as understanding how OO concepts are supported by a particular
language. It is insightful to understand the simple OO fundamentals and how
these map to the particular implementation provided by Python.

In this talk I will first explain the very basics of OO from a language-neutral
point of view with the aim of showing what OO can offer you and to give a
glimpse of the simple mathematical theory underlying OO. I hope to give you
enough information to help you distinguish between better and worse designs and
to detect whether you're using OO as it was intended. I will also briefly show
how these fundamentals map to Python.

This talk is for anyone: whether you're new at Object Orientation, or a
practitioner wondering whether OO is worth the effort you've spent trying to
use it.
