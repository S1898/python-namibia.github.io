A lot of my work is interfacing with outside systems, and Python is excellent
for providing the glue between them.

I'd provide a short introduction (introducing concepts like REST, RPC, JSON...), and then Python
libraries to talk to a few of them.

I'll showcase some examples, and demonstrate how we can interface with systems such as Google
Translate's API.
