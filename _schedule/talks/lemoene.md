Illustrated by many donor and government initiatives underway in our region, health care is receiving well deserved attention. Electronic Medical Records (EMR) and Laboratory Information Management Systems (LIMS) are important tools for timely and preventative care to protect and improve public health.

There are many opportunities for web-based LIMS and instrument integration, bringing about vast gains in turnaround times and accuracy, for all labs big and small, anywhere.

[Bika Health](https://health.bikalabs.com/) and [Bika LIMS](https://demo.bikalabs.com/) are robust and affordable world-leading open-source systems, used in medical and vetinary settings. They're built in Python and JavaScript, using the Plone CMS framework, by members of the Bika Open Source LIMS Collective at [BikaLIMS.org](https://www.bikalims.org), and implemented by users and clients world wide.
