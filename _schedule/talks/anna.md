I will discuss how I started learning programming, the first
programming language I learnt and how it enabled me to learn other languages
and platforms quite easily after that.

I also intend to show the similarities in the logic of loops in most programming languages, only
differing in syntax and how that is an advantage to programmers.

I also intend to highlight the advantages programmers now have of sites such as StackOverFlow,
GitHub etc where they can get help, which we did not have back in 2000 as we had no Internet access
in our school.
