In 2015, in Windhoek I started a Python library, Axelrod, that replicates a
game theoretic computer tournament.

In this talk I will discuss how this library became (relatively) popular: in particular
highlighting everything the various contributions taught me.

I will also discuss how it can be used to model not only evolution but the complicated process of
exchanging gifts at Christmas.
