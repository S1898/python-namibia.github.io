title: "Simulating quantum systems in less than 20 lines of pure Python"
speaker: Katie Barr
location: Room 01
day: Thursday
duration: 45 minutes
---

Quantum theory is famously difficult and paradoxical, but exploring quantum
systems numerically in high level languages such as Python is surprisingly
easy.

In this talk I will describe, step by step, how to simulate a particular
system, the *discrete time quantum walk*, with just 15 lines of Python code.

You don't need to be physicist to understand and enjoy this talk, and the material is simple enough that you'll be anble to go on to develop your own simulations of these systems.
