I would like to share my Journey with Python so far from a beginner
perspective, and how it was a tool in discovering myself.

I will go on to tell a story of how a Django Girls event which will happen in
February in Lagos, Nigeria brought about the creation of a Nigerian Python
community and how it might also turn out to be the first gathering of the
Nigerian Python users group.

Python in Africa is growing - the resources are there, and as Vincent Van Gogh said: "Great things are done by a series of small things brought together."
