Building a simple interactive fiction game with Asyncio and WebSockets.

In the 1980s, before the internet, before broadband, before retina displays,
there were bulletin board systems, low speed modems and displays that showed 80
by 40 characters. In these resource constrained conditions, text interfaces and
textual services flourished and provide real value to the people that used
them.

For many people throughout Africa, similar conditions exist today. They connect
to the wider world via 2G GSM modems and over unreliable infrastructure, using
devices with low-resolution screens.

Text interfaces are still important.

In this workshop we will attempt to build a simple interactive fiction game
using modern software including the AsyncIO aiohttp library, Python 3 and
WebSockets.

While our game will have fictional content, the same ideas could be used to
build services that encourage people to engage with vital information and
concepts that might improve, for example, their health.

The technologies have been chosen for their broad range of applicability, both
to modern web development and to low-end text-based services such as SMS
(similar to traditional HTTP requests) and USSD or star codes (similar to
WebSockets).
