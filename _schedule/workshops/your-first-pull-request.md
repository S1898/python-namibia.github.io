A hands-on workshop that leads attendees through the process of submitting a good pull request to a
project of their choice.

We'll cover things like:

* what maintainers want in a pull request
* contribution guidelines
* the right attitude towards getting something from maintainers (who often work in their free time)

as well as the practical steps involved.
