Many programmers new to Python ask themselves these questions, soon after
learning the language: “Now that I have learnt Programming with Python, how can
I use it? What software programs can I develop with it?”

While there is a lot of information available on the internet on the examples of powerful
applications that have been developed with Python, many first time programmers find themselves
stuck as what they can develop and how they can develop their idea in Python.

I'll help to address this gap by focusing
on using Python and Django to develop web applications that address day-to-day
problems in the business world or community.

We will consider:

* problem identification
* proposing a solution/system to address the problem identified
* implementation of the project.

I will use an example to show how each of these stages can be carried out to lead to the
development of a web application using Python and Django.
