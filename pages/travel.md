For PyCon Namibia we expect more visitors from all over the world.

## Windhoek

Windhoek, Namibia's capital city, is a compact town of just over 320 thousand people. It's a safe,
pleasant and convenient city for visitors, with numerous hotels, restaurants, sites to visit and
shopping centres.

Windhoek's main airport (Hosea Kutako) is a 20-minute drive from the centre.

## Getting to Windhoek

Windhoek has several direct daily connections to Frankfurt, Johannesburg and several African
cities. For most international travellers connections via Frankfurt or Johannesburg are most
convenient.

## Health and vaccinations

Medical services in Namibia are of a high standard.

Tap water is clean and safe to drink.

Moderate precautions are advised against mosquito bites, which can carry malaria, though the risk
in Windhoek is minimal.

No vaccinations are **required** for travellers from most countries, though visitors from some
countries may be required to show proof of certain vaccinations.

However it is **recommended** that Hepatitis A, Tetanus and Typhoid immunisation is up-to-date. If
you are considering travelling outside Windhoek you should consider vaccination against Cholera,
Diphtheria, Hepatitis B and Rabies.

There is no risk of yellow fever in the country.

## Currency

The Namibian dollar is linked to the South African rand and can be exchanged on a one-to-one basis
locally. Attendees who would like to buy currency for their trip before travelling will find it
easier to buy rand than Namibian dollars.

## Visas

Travellers to Namibia who are travelling for the purpose of attending the conference will be
considered as **business travellers**. Business travellers from most countries will require a visa.
See the website of the [Namibian High Commission](http://www.namibiahc.org.uk/need_visa.php) in
London for more information.

It is **not recommended** that attendees declare their purpose of travel as leisure in order to
avoid business visa requirements.
