PyCon Namibia is an initiative of the Namibian Python community - software
professionals, scientists, academics and students, who believe in the power of
open-source software. This initiative is supported by the [University of
Namibia](http://www.unam.na/) and the [Cardiff University Phoenix
Project](http://www.cardiff.ac.uk/phoenix-project).

The community has already been host to successful Python conferences:
