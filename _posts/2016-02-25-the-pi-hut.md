excerpt: "Thank you for our lab of 50 Raspberry Pis."

To help ensure our workshop labs were up and running with little installation
barriers, we are delighted to have had 50 Raspberry Pis that all delegates have
been able to use. This was thanks to the very graceful discount offered to us
from [the Pi Hut](http://thepihut.com/).

These machines not only provided an excellent environment for the workshops but
will be left to the Python Namibia Society to be of use for their outreach
activities.

Thanks to Jamie and The Pi Hut for their support and which has proved absolutely
invaluable at the event.
