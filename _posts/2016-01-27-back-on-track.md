Following yesterday's enforced pause, we're back on track today (Wednesday) with our first day of talks, at the [Safari Hotel Conference centre](http://www.safarihotelsnamibia.com) (Corner of Auas and Aviation Streets).

We start at 09.00 sharp, with a keynote address from Loek van Gent.

Welcome back to PyCon Namibia!
