The [Praekelt Foundation](http://praekeltfoundation.org) uses open-source technologies to deliver essential information and inclusive services to millions of people around the world.

The Praekelt Foundation have not only supported the event, but have sent two of their developers as paticipants, Simon Cross and Codie Roelf.

One of the Foundation's projects featured at PyCon Namibia will be MomConnect, an open source mobile health system aimed at improving maternal health services at a national scale.

We're very grateful to have the Praekelt Foundation's support.
